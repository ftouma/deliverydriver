This application aims to enhance productivity for food delivery drivers using an android device. It is designed with a car dock in mind. Features include automatic tip and reimbursement tabulation (separate tip counts for non-cash orders), quick navigate and phone call shortcuts, customer databases (addresses, comments, and tip history), and I plan to include shift database for total wage calculations, miles driven via gps, and end-of-year totals. This is my first project so whatever I make it public even though I don't know what I'm doing.
